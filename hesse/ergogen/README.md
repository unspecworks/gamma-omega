# gamma-omega-hesse - Ergogen files

This is based on the [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) configuration file
at `../../tc36k/config.yaml` which describes the Gamma-Omega TC36K keyboard mono PCB.
The changes are to use a smaller "SuperMini NRF52840" controller, with less GPIO pins
and thus a different wiring net, and make a cut out for the inclusion of a battery.
Otherwise the PCB outline and switch placement should be unchanged.

Run ergogen on the whole folder to get it to look at the footprints:

```console
‚ùØ ergogen gc36k/ergogen/
Ergogen v4.1.0 CLI
