# gamma-omega-tc36k - Ergogen files

The original Gamma-Omega design has a left & right PCB (with the same reversible design),
joined at the middle with the controller daughter board itself.
The original [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) configuration file at
`../../original/ergogen/config.yaml` described the Gamma-Omega keyboard double-sided twin PCB design.

That was modified, initially using mirroring to make a single 36 key PCB.
It now uses a full 40-pin Raspberry Pi Pico controller footprint.
That required enlarging the top edge of the PCB by 2mm, which now matches the controller.
This still fits in the same case.
The wiring net is defined using a partial Tutte-Coxeter graph,
with 26/30 nodes/vertices/pins and 36/45 edges/switches/keys.

Run ergogen on the whole folder to get it to look at the footprints:

```console
‚ùØ ergogen tc36k/ergogen/
